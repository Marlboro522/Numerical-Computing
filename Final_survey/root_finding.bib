Neta, Comparative study of eighth-order methods for finding simple roots of nonlinear equations, Numer. Algor. 74, 1169–1201, 2017). In the first part, we show that the best ranking method, constructed by Sharma and Arora in 2016, is actually a special case of the family of three-point methods presented in the paper (J. Džunić, M. S. Petkovic, L. D. Petkovic, A family of optimal three-point methods for solving nonlinear equations using two parametric functions, Appl. Math. Comput. 217, 7612–7619, 2011). Since the mentioned Chun-Neta’s comparative study was carried out by testing algebraic polynomials of low degree (not higher than 6), in the second part we have extended comparative study to higher-order polynomials, polynomials with random coefficients, and polynomials with clusters of zeros. The performed experiments confirmed results of Chun and Neta. As in the cited paper of Chun and Neta, we have also applied the quality study based on computer visualization plotting the basins of attraction.},

	abstract = {Given a univariate real polynomial, this paper considers calculating all the real zero-points of the polynomial simultaneously. Among several numerical methods for calculating zero-points of a univariate polynomial, Durand-Kerner method is quite useful because it is most stable to converge to the zero-points. On the basis of Durand-Kerner method, we propose two methods for calculating the real zero-points of a univariate polynomial simultaneously. Convergence and error analysis of our methods are discussed. We compared our methods, the original Durand-Kerner method and Newton’s method and found that 1) our methods are more stable than Newton’s method but less than the original Durand-Kerner method, and 2) they are more efficient than the original Durand-Kerner method but less than Newton’s method. We conclude that our methods are useful when good initial values of the zero-points are known.},

The algorithm is obtained as a combination of existing third-order methods by specifying a parameter involved. The algorithm is based on local and semilocal analysis and has been specifically designed to improve efficiency and accuracy. The proposed algorithm represents a significant improvement over existing iterative algorithms. In particular, it is tested on a range of polynomial functions and was found to produce accurate and efficient results, with improved performance over existing algorithms in terms of both speed and accuracy. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and suggest that it has great potential for use in a wide range of applications in polynomiography and other areas of mathematical analysis.},

To accomplish these objectives, we present a multi-part survey. In part one, we focus on root-finding approaches which can be used to search for solutions to a SNE without transforming it into an optimization problem. In part two, we will introduce the various transformations which have been utilized to transform a SNE into an optimization problem, and we discuss optimization algorithms which can then be used to search for solutions.
